Models of sdlc

1.Waterfall model(top to down approach)taking too much time and costly and client interaction is none.

2.Incremental model
Project===>|---module1(it should be a complete Entity)(front-end)
           |---module2(back-end)
           |---module3
Each Module should be verify by the costumer/client and maintenance cost is less and debugging is easy and consume less time as compare to waterfall 

3.Prototype model(when client is not able to give the details properly):
Base structure will show to client and let them decide and get their requirements and get the approval before starting the process
--Maintenance cost is less 

4.Agile model start sub-module together and it takes less time and maintenance 
its framework or template is scrum and Kanban
